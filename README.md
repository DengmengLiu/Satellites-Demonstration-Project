## Project Overview  
This project is a **Unity-based demonstration video** designed to assist my supervisor in presenting his research on **low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication**. The video showcases how satellites interact with ground stations and each other through a structured three-scene narrative:  

- **Satellite Network Overview**: Transition from a global satellite network to a single satellite’s functionality.  
- **Satellite-to-Ground Communication**: A satellite sends a signal to a ground station, which relays information to another satellite due to orbital motion differences.  
- **Inter-Satellite Communication**: The second satellite transmits data back to the original satellite, demonstrating cross-satellite communication.  

## Technical Implementation  

### Game Development  
- Built in **Unity**, using **Timeline** for camera transitions and scene sequencing.  

### 3D Modeling & Animation  
- Created **signal models** using **Blender** with optimized geometry for real-time rendering.  
- Implemented **Timeline-controlled animations** for smooth transitions between different perspectives.  

### Interactive Systems  
- Developed a **custom C# script** to simulate satellite orbits and signal transmission.  
- Adjusted **scale and positioning** to approximate **Starlink’s low-earth orbit**, ensuring realistic movement patterns.  

### Camera Control  
- Used **Cinemachine** for dynamic camera angles.  
- Applied **fade-in/out effects** to create seamless transitions.  

### Version Control  
- Managed project updates and iterations through **GitHub**.  

## Impact & Results  
- **Deliverables**: Multiple formats of the demonstration video (recorded video **(1m 40s)** and executable file).  

## Project Management & Collaboration  
- **GitHub Version Control**: Used to track development progress and manage revisions.  
- **Iterative Development**: Worked closely with my supervisor, refining the project based on feedback.
